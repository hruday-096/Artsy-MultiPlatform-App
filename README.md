# Artsy — Multi-Platform Artist Discovery App

**Artsy** is a full-stack, multi-platform application designed to help users discover artists, explore their artworks and biographies, and save their favorites—all through an elegant and responsive user experience. Built with a shared **Node.js + Express** backend, it powers both a **React web app** and a native **Jetpack Compose Android app**, maintaining consistent data flow and user state across platforms.

The application integrates seamlessly with the [Artsy API](https://developers.artsy.net/v2/) to retrieve rich artist data and media, while leveraging **MongoDB Atlas** for persistent user data and favorites.

## Project Architecture

This project follows a **modular, cross-platform architecture**:
- **Shared Backend**: Both web and mobile clients interact with a single Express API server, ensuring consistent session management and data.
- **Decoupled Clients**: The React frontend and Android app were built independently, enabling future expansion to other platforms like iOS or desktop.
